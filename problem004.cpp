/*========== Project Euler: Problem 4 ==========
Largest palindrome product
Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
=========================*/

/*========== program design notes ==========
Need two helper functions.
function one will multiply two 3-digits numbers together.
function two will check if the number resulting from function 1 is a palindrome.

reversing a number:
my first instinct was to convert it into a string and check; 
but after trying to think of a way without strings I came up with a solution where I take log(num)+1 for # of digits
  then use a for loop to reverse number using for( i = (log(num)+1); i > 0; i--) {last digit * 10 * i}
but there is a more clever way to do it. reverse = reverse * 10 + last_digit
  
biggest possible number is 998001 (999 * 999) so we can use int to hold all numbers.

assuming my method of multiplying large numbers in decreasing order and checking if 
they are palindromes once a palindrome is found the number of possible palindrome 
checks decreases. if a palindrome is found. assuming x is a palindrome and x = a * b, where b < a. 
the lower bound which we need to check then becomes a < b. this method works because 
in the case of a * b, the case of number = a * b, where a > b will always be evaluated first,
before it reaches the case of number = b * a.
