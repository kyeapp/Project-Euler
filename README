Project-Euler
=============

All coding done using C++11.

compile a project using "g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra problem001.cpp"
default program name z

I used a free BigInteger library when computing numbers that were bigger than ints and longs could handle.

If the BigInteger library needed, edit the makefile on lines 56 for the specific file
and compile using the makefile.

The goal for each problem was to design an program that could compute the answers in less than a second. 
I prioritized speed and modularity when writing and designing the code. I also made the input size
scalable so I could test on small data sets to confirm the correctness of the program before have it
run the large data set.


Due to the discovery of a serious security issue a decision was made on Sunday 15 June 2014 to 
take down the website. The full extent of the issue is still being investigated but in an attempt 
to be as honest as possible to our members we must make you aware that we have reason to suspect 
that all or parts of the database may have compromised. Passwords at Project Euler are strongly 
encrypted using a one-way hash, but if you use the same password at other websites then it is strongly 
advised that you change it. We are extremely sorry for this inconvenience. At this time we can provide 
no more information and there is no indication when Project Euler will return. 6/15/2014
