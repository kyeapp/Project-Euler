/*========== Project Euler: Problem 28 ==========
Number spiral diagonals
Problem 28

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

[21] 22  23  24 [25]
 20 [07] 08 [09] 10
 19  06 [01] 02  11
 18 [05] 04 [03] 12
[17] 16  15  14 [13]

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
=========================*/

/*========== program design notes ==========
I have observed that starting from the center we only need to add 2 to the number to get the bottom-right, 
add the 2 more for the bottom-left key, add two more for the top-left, and then add two more for the top right.
the we add 4 four times for the next corners, then 6, then 8. we'd only need to add numbers in the right pattern
to get the answer. This can be found in linear time Î¸(n).
